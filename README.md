## How Spaced Repetition Works

Based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve research:

```
Initial Learning -> Review Day 1 -> Day 3 -> Day 7 -> Day 14 -> Day 30 -> Day 60 -> Day 120

Performance adjustments:
- Score >=80%: Longer intervals (you've got it!)
- Score 60-79%: Standard intervals
- Score <60%: Shorter intervals + step back
```

**Result:** 70%+ better long-term retention compared to cramming!
